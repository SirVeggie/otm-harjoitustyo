# Requirements specification

## Purpose

A game that provides entertainment for people that have nothing better to do.

The game is about turtle races. You try to guess which turtle will win the race based on the provided information. 
Ideally the player can learn the effects of each piece of information and estimate the winner based on them with 100% accuracy.

## Users

(Maybe) Tester/Developer - Has improved rights to access cheats and tools to test how the game works.

## Interface

## Basic functionality

### Settings

- (?)You can turn on/off developer(testing) mode
- (?) Change difficulty

### Gameplay

- Each turtle has a limited amount of information attached to them, which will determine how fast the turtle will proceed towards the goal.
- Effects can be for example changes to the turtle's linear speed or cause sudden changes to occur, maybe even affect other turtles.
- Effects can be positive or negative.
- The amount of negative and positive effects should be close to each other.
